<h6 align="center"> RPG & Cyber Security Fantasy Game, Creation Date: November 28, 2023 </h6>


***

<h3 align="center">Game Overview</h3>

***



**Created and played** with **Shell** commands on **terminal** using a mix of **.sh** with **.py** and **.md scripts.** The **RPG-Cyber-Security** named **PentesterRPG** has **ten thousand 30-digit unique keys spread across all over the map.**

**The adventurer mission is to conquer the Ethereal Empire unlocking all the doors**. This project is aimed to **train programming skills on players without any knowledge, through a fun and educational RPG game experience**. It can also be used by **higher level players, that are simply looking for a funny way of practicing.** 

The game **includes interactions with various programs that I will create inside of this game to serve the purpose of a simulated NPC**. During the Adventure you will find **special items, hints, pets, enemies, bosses, and other surprises ahead**.

 The first day of the project, I worked on it for 48 hours straight and created all the 10000 maps and the 10000 30-digit keys, demonstrating how enthusiastic and committed to programming I am. As the project continues to evolve, I plan to incorporate more features and content, ensuring that PentesterRPG remains an enjoyable cybersecurity training tool or RPG game. This is a huge project because it can be used to **register my learning progress** in **Computer Science, Programming, Cyber Security and IT**.
