###### 24/7 continuous planning updates :
- [x] Implementing key listenners to add sound-based everytime the user comes across some point of the game. 
- [x] Implementing key listenners to add text-based everytime the user comes across some point of the game.
- [x] Improving game content (design, vulnerabilities, structure, files, encryption, folders, text, sound, pictures, summits, shortcuts and others..) 
- [x] Generating content to fullfill the 6000 maps created on the first day.


#### Game Full Description - Conquering the Ethereal Empire

RPG game called "Pentes" that consists of 3000 levels, 50 different kingdoms, and 60 different realms. The game is designed to be played using Linux terminal commands such as nano or less, and it aims to train players in cybersecurity and Linux programming through a fun and educational experience. The game includes special items, inventory, hints, pets, enemies, bosses, and the ability to mix up dropped items to produce something needed to encrypt harder rooms. The game will be updated regularly, and a brief description of the changes will be provided in the oldupdates.txt file. You plan to get a license for the game, and you have copyrights for all the content. You also plan to combine the game privately placed on GitHub with another virtual code space you will create for players. The game will come with audio and text included, and players will have both a terminal and screen splitting terminal with markdown files to provide a GUI-like experience. The graphical images will be created by an AI using high-quality pictures throughout the game. You are unsure if you can save copyrights on the images generated by the AI. The game's narrative is set in a fantastical world where players assume the role of adventurers tasked with navigating through a series of challenges and riddles that align with the fantasy setting, providing an immersive experience. The game's educational focus is on training players in cybersecurity and Linux programming, making it an excellent platform for learning and practicing these skills. The combination of terminal-based gameplay and markdown-based visuals creates a unique and interactive experience that appeals to a wide audience. The game's development process has been meticulous, with a strong emphasis on ensuring a high-quality and engaging experience for players. The first day of the project, you worked on it for 48 hours straight, demonstrating your enthusiasm and commitment to the project. As the project continues to evolve, you plan to incorporate more features and content, ensuring that "Conquering the Ethereal Empire" remains a cutting-edge and enjoyable cybersecurity training tool. In conclusion, "Conquering the Ethereal Empire" is a promising cybersecurity RPG game that combines the best of both educational and entertaining content. With a strong focus on cybersecurity and Linux programming, the game offers a unique and engaging experience for players while providing an excellent platform for learning and practicing these skills. The combination of terminal-based gameplay and markdown-based visuals makes the game stand out as a creative and effective cybersecurity training tool.
To create a terminal listener with shell code (Zsh in Linux Kali) to read when a player enters a path and pop up a markdown file together with the new path directory they have entered, you can use a combination of shell scripting and markdown rendering tools. Here are the general steps to achieve this:

    Create a shell script that listens for changes in the current directory and triggers the display of a markdown file when a new path is entered.
    Use a markdown rendering tool to display the contents of the markdown file in the terminal.
    Integrate the shell script with the markdown rendering tool to achieve the desired behavior.

Here are some resources that can help you achieve this:

    You can use Pandoc and Lynx to view markdown files in the terminal. Pandoc can convert markdown to other formats, and Lynx is a text-based web browser that can be run in the terminal1
    .
    You can highlight bash/shell commands in markdown using code blocks with the appropriate language identifier, for example, ```bash2
    .
    You can execute shell scripts in R Markdown using the bash or zsh engine, depending on which shell you prefer3
    .
    You can use shell scripting to create a listener that triggers the display of a markdown file when a new path is entered in the terminal4
    .
    Markdown doesn't natively support image captions, but you can use HTML tags to add a caption for your image if your Markdown application supports HTML5
    .

By combining these resources, you can create a terminal listener with shell code to achieve the desired behavior.
