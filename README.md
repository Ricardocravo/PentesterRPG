<h6 align="center"> RPG & Cyber Security Fantasy Game, Creation Date: November 28, 2023 </h6>

<h3 align="center">Game Overview</h3>

***

**Created & played** with **Shell & Python code**, the **RPG-Cyber-Security**, named **PentesterRPG** has 10k levels of decryption and 10k 30-digit unique keys built across all over the map. They are currently locked. After you unlocked them, they will be used to unlock another map or a special event**. **The difficulty in encryption will increase** just as the player advances in the game. It will also be useful to register my growth in studying Computer Science, Programming, Cyber Security and IT.

**The adventurer mission is to conquer the Ethereal Empire**. The game is **designed to be played using shell commands on the terminal**, **aiming to train players without any knowledge in cybersecurity and shell programming through a fun and educational RPG game experience**. It can also be used by **higher level players, that are simply looking for a funny way of practicing.** 

The game **includes interactions with various programs that I will create inside of this game to serve the purpose of a simulated NPC**. During the Adventure you will find **special items, hints, pets, enemies, bosses, and other surprises ahead**.

**Game is placed on GitHub with copyrights and without authorization for changes unless you're a selected collaborator by me**. You can download the game to play it for free, currently the game is still offline. All the files where created by me, all the texts where written solo, all the pictures where generated by me with an AI, all the sounds where downloadd from no copyrights sound databased, in which author is shared inside the sounds folder. 

**The game has all the dependencies, markdowns, audios, and text files needed**. **The system provides a simulated GUI experience that is suited for gaming and learning without affecting the performance of both players and database structures**. **Any person** who knows only one programming language **can still play the game** without having issues. **The combination of terminal-based gameplay and markdown-based visuals creates a unique and interactive experience.**

 The first day of the project, I worked on it for 48 hours straight and created all the 6000 maps and the 6000 30-digit keys, demonstrating how enthusiastic and committed to programming I am. As the project continues to evolve, I plan to incorporate more features and content, ensuring that PentesterRPG remains an enjoyable cybersecurity training tool or RPG game.

<h5 align="center"> 24/7 Continuous planning updates </h5>

- [x] Implementing connections between the terminal input and output, programs representing NPC and files that simulate interaction.
- [x] Implementing key listeners to the terminal to add sound, text, markdown, and the NPC program every time it comes across some condition x.
- [x] Improving game content (design, vulnerabilities, structure, files, cyber security, folders, text, sound, pictures, summits, shortcuts, and others.)
- [x] Generating content to fulfill the 6000 maps created on the first day.
- [x] Implementing a fight possibility with
npcs

<h5 align="center"> Future important updates </h5>

- [ ] Use Pandoc and Lynx to view markdown files in the terminal.
- [ ] Highlight shell commands in markdown using code blocks with the appropriate language identifier.
- [ ] Execute shell scripts in R Markdown using the shell engine.
- [ ] Shell scripting to create a listener that triggers the display of a markdown file when a new path is entered in the terminal.
- [ ] Shell scripting to create a listener that triggers the display of a text file when a new path is entered in the terminal.
- [ ] Shell scripting to create a listener that triggers the display of a sound file when a new path is entered in the terminal.
- [ ] More added soon.
