<h6 align="center"> RPG & Cyber Security Fantasy Game, Creation Date: November 28, 2023 </h6>

<h3 align="center">Game Overview</h3>

***

Created and played using **Shell code**, the **RPG inspired in Cyber Security PentesterRPG has 6000 levels of decryption. Also, 6000 30-digit unique keys were built across all the kingdoms and realms. They are locked, and after unlocking, they will be used to unlock another map or a special event**. **The difficulty in encryption will increase** just as the player advances in the game. It will also be useful to register my growth in studying Computer Science, Programming, Cyber Security and IT.

**The adventurer mission is conquering the ethereal empire**. The game is **designed to be played using shell commands on the terminal**, **aiming to train players in cybersecurity and shell programming through a fun and educational RPG game experience**. The game **includes interactions with various programs I will create inside of this game to serve the purpose of a simulated NPC**. During the Adventure you will find **special items, hints, pets, enemies, bosses, and other surprises ahead**.

**Game is placed on GitHub with copyrights and without authorization for changes unless you're a selected collaborator by me**. You can download the game to play it for free to play offline. Further in the future, I will develop it online and improve it with more levels. **The game has all the dependencies, markdowns, audios, and text files needed**. **The system provides a simulated GUI experience that is suited for gaming and learning without affecting the performance of both players and database structures**. Some programs that represent all the types of NPCS the game has will be done using Python, Java, or C, which means that any person who knows only one programming language can still play the game without having issues. The combination of terminal-based gameplay and markdown-based visuals creates a unique and interactive experience.

The game will be updated regularly, including a description of the changes implemented, which will be located in the UPDATES.md file. The game has full copyrights except for the sounds, which will be downloaded from a database that has no copyrights. The graphical images will be created by an AI using high-quality pictures throughout the game. The first day of the project, I worked on it for 48 hours straight and created all the 6000 maps and the 6000 30-digit keys, demonstrating how enthusiastic and committed to programming I am. As the project continues to evolve, I plan to incorporate more features and content, ensuring that PentesterRPG remains an enjoyable cybersecurity training tool or RPG game.

<h5 align="center"> 24/7 Continuous planning updates </h5>

- [x] Implementing connections between the terminal input and output, programs representing NPC and files that simulate interaction.
- [x] Implementing key listeners to the terminal to add sound, text, markdown, and the NPC program every time it comes across some condition x.
- [x] Improving game content (design, vulnerabilities, structure, files, cyber security, folders, text, sound, pictures, summits, shortcuts, and others.)
- [x] Generating content to fulfill the 6000 maps created on the first day.

***

<h5 align="center"> Future important updates </h5>

- [ ] Use Pandoc and Lynx to view markdown files in the terminal.
- [ ] Highlight shell commands in markdown using code blocks with the appropriate language identifier.
- [ ] Execute shell scripts in R Markdown using the shell engine.
- [ ] Shell scripting to create a listener that triggers the display of a markdown file when a new path is entered in the terminal.
- [ ] Shell scripting to create a listener that triggers the display of a text file when a new path is entered in the terminal.
- [ ] Shell scripting to create a listener that triggers the display of a sound file when a new path is entered in the terminal.
- [ ] More added soon.
