##### <div align="center"> RPG & Cyber Security Fantasy Game - Creation Date : 28-11-2023 </div>

***
## <div align="center"> Game Overview  </div>
***

Created and played using **Shell code**, the **RPG inspired in Cyber Security "PentesterRPG"** consists in **6000 levels of decryption**. **6000 30-digit unique keys where built across all the kingdoms. They are locked and after unlocking they will be used to unlock another map or a special event**. **The difficulty in encryption will increase** just as the player advances in game. It will also be usefull to register my growth in studying Computer Science, Programming, Cyber Security and IT.

**The adventurer mission is conquering the ethereal empire**. The game is **designed to be played using shell commands on the terminal**, **aiming to train players in cybersecurity and shell programming through a fun and educational RPG game experience**. The game **includes interactions with various programs i will create inside of this game to serve the purpose of a simulated NPC**. During the Adventure you will find **special items, hints, pets, enemies, bosses, and other surprises ahead**.

**Game is placed on GitHub with copyrights and without authorization for changes unless you're a selected colaborator by me**. You can download the game to play it for free offline, further on the future i will develop it online and improve it with more levels. **The game has all the dependencies, markdowns, audios and text files needed**. **The system provides a simulated GUI experience that is suited for gaming and learning, without affecting the performance of both players and database structures**. Some programs that represent all the types of NPCS the game has will be done using python, java or c that means that any person that knows only one programming language can still play the game without having issues. The combination of terminal-based gameplay and markdown-based visuals creates a unique and interactive experience.

The game will be updated regularly including a description of the changes implemented, they will be located at UPDATES.md file. Game has full copyrights except for the sounds, which will be downloaded from a database that has no copyrights. The graphical images will be created by an AI using high-quality pictures throughout the game. The first day of the project, I worked on it for 48 hours straight, and created all the 6000 maps and the 6000 30-digits keys, demonstrating how enthusiasm and commitment to programming I am. As the project continues to evolve, I plan to incorporate more features and content ensuring that PentesterRPG remains an enjoyable cybersecurity training tool or RPG game.

<div align="center"> 24/7 continuous planning updates :

- [x] Implementing connections between the terminal input and output, programs representing NPC and files that simulate interaction.  
- [x] Implementing key listenners to the terminal, to add sound, text, markdown, and the NPC program everytime it comes across some condition x.
- [x] Improving game content (design, vulnerabilities, structure, files, cyber security, folders, text, sound, pictures, summits, shortcuts and others..) 
- [x] Generating content to fullfill the 6000 maps created on the first day.
