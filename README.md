# Game Full Description


### RPG & Cyber Security Fantasy Game - Creation Date : 28-11-2023 

Created and played using **Shell code**, the **RPG inspired in Cyber Security "PentesterRPG"** consists in **6000 levels of decryption**. **6000 30-digit unique keys where built across all the kingdoms. They are locked and after unlocking they will be used to unlock another map or a special event**. **The difficulty in encryption will increase** just as the player advances in game. It will also be usefull to register my growth in studying Computer Science, Programming, Cyber Security And IT. **The adventure is across different kingdoms and realms**. The game is **designed to be played using Linux shell commands on the terminal**, **aiming to train players in cybersecurity and Linux programming through a fun and educational RPG game experience**. The game **includes interactions with various programs i will create inside of this game to serve the purpose of a simulated NPC.** During the Adventure you will find **special items, hints, pets, enemies, bosses, and other surprises ahead**. **Game is placed on GitHub with copyrights and without authorization for changes unless you're a selected colaborator by me. You can download the game to play it for free offline, further on the future i will develop it online and improve it with more levels.** **The game has all the dependencies, markdowns, audios and text files needed**. **The system provides a simulated GUI experience that is suited for gaming and learning, without affecting the performance of both players and database structures.** The game's narrative is set in a **fantasy world where players assume the role of adventurers through a series of challenges and riddles providing an immersive experience. The combination of terminal-based gameplay and markdown-based visuals creates a unique and interactive experience.

The game will be updated regularly, and a structured description of the changes will be implemented in the UPDATES.md file. Game has full copyrights except for the sounds, which will be downloaded from a norights database center. The graphical images will be created by an AI using high-quality pictures throughout the game. The first day of the project, I worked on it for 48 hours straight, demonstrating your enthusiasm and commitment to the project. As the project continues to evolve, i plan to incorporate more features and content, ensuring that PentesterRPG remains a an enjoyable cybersecurity training tool.
