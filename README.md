#### Game Full Description

Shell written RPG game called "PentesterRPG" that consists of 6000 levels of decryption already made on the first creation day. The adventure is across different kingdoms and realms. The game is designed to be played using Linux terminal commands, it aims to train players in cybersecurity and Linux programming through a fun and educational RPG game experience. The game includes special items, inventory, hints, pets, enemies, bosses, and the ability to mix up dropped items to produce something needed to decrypt harder rooms. Game will privately be placed on GitHub, and i will give you another virtual code space or you can create one for you to use my game. The game will come with dependencies, markdown, audio and text files included. Players will have both a terminal and screen splitting terminal with markdown files to provide a GUI-like experience.The game's narrative is set in a fantastical world where players assume the role of adventurers tasked with navigating through a series of challenges and riddles that align with the fantasy setting, providing an immersive experience. The combination of terminal-based gameplay and markdown-based visuals creates a unique and interactive experience. 

The game will be updated regularly, and a structured description of the changes will be implemented in the UPDATES.md file. Game has full copyrights except for the sounds, which will be downloaded from a norights database center. The graphical images will be created by an AI using high-quality pictures throughout the game. The first day of the project, I worked on it for 48 hours straight, demonstrating your enthusiasm and commitment to the project. As the project continues to evolve, i plan to incorporate more features and content, ensuring that PentesterRPG remains a an enjoyable cybersecurity training tool.
