The game includes special items, inventory, hints, pets, enemies, bosses, and the ability to mix up dropped items to produce something needed to decrypt harder rooms. Game will privately be placed on GitHub, and i will give you another virtual code space or you can create one for you to use my game. The game will come with dependencies, audio and text included. Players will have both a terminal and screen splitting terminal with markdown files to provide a GUI-like experience.The game's narrative is set in a fantastical world where players assume the role of adventurers tasked with navigating through a series of challenges and riddles that align with the fantasy setting, providing an immersive experience.

The graphical images will be created by an AI using high-quality pictures throughout the game.
