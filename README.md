<h6 align="center">RPG & Cyber Security Fantasy Game, Creation Date: November 28, 2023</h6>

***

<h3 align="center"> Game Overview </h3>
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD033 MD041 -->

***

Created and played with **Shell** commands on **terminal** using a mix of **.sh**, **.py** and **.md scripts. \
PentesterRPG** was inspired in RPG and Cyber-Security. It has **ten thousand 30-digit unique keys spread across all over the map. The adventurer mission is to conquer the Ethereal Empire unlocking all the doors**. \
The game **includes interactions with various programs that I will create inside of this game to serve the purpose of a simulated NPC**. During the Adventure you will find **special items, hints, pets, enemies, bosses, and other surprises ahead**. \
This project is aimed to **train programming skills on players without any knowledge, through a fun and educational RPG game experience**. It can also be used by higher level players, that are simply looking for a funny way of practicing. As the project continues to evolve, I plan to incorporate more features and content, ensuring that PentesterRPG remains an enjoyable cybersecurity training tool or RPG game.

This is a huge project because it can be used to **register my learning progress** in **Computer Science, Programming, Cyber Security and IT.**
