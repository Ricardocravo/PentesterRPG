## Reporting a Vulnerability

Sadly, there are no payments or rewards for reporting vulnerabilities outside of an established 
bug bounty program setted earlier as i am not able to afford that, and that's why i've 
started as a Sole developer beguinning with a huge idea i had.

Please kindly report it to me as soon as possible. I take security very 
seriously thank's to CS50, and I am committed in addressing any 
vulnerabilities as fast as I can or to explain that it was meant to be
like that, remembering the game is a mix of RPG with Cyber Security.

If you've found a vulnerability please send an email to pentesterrpg@gmail.com 
describing the issue with most of the details in order to make me able to 
reproduce the vulnerability. I will let you know about the receipt 
of your report within 24hours and will work to verify and reproduce the 
vulnerability as quickly as possible, so that i can start searching for a fix.
I will provide regular updates while on progress. 

Please respect the privacy of others and make reasonable efforts to contact us
before disclosing any vulnerabilities publicly. As a sole developer of this game
my responsability is to address alone all the vulnerabilities and improve the security 
of PentesterRPG.

I appreciate your help in keeping the project secure and welcome any feedback or 
suggestions that you might may have.
