Zoey the wounded teaches some secrets to survive during the next seasons:

inside of going to the maps with your explorer, you would have more fun if you only used terminal.
You can use explorer for saving map and bag items if it's easier for you. 
The Conquering_The_Ethereal_Empire should be played entirely using terminal and a notepad or someplace to save notes.
The thing is you can save notes inside your terminal or explorer in order to use them later, you just need to give them good names that makes sense.
So that you get a good design and never get lost. Feel free to organize my information the way you feel like in your place.
Play the game your way as i have also played my way and now i am wounded. 

You will copy all of the needed assistances to your map.txt During the game you can create as many as maps.txt you want
And give them as many names as you feel like to. Just please organize them into names so that you don't get stuck.
I have created a home for you, it allows you to save the game if you need to deposit everything inside your home, instead of travelling with you.
You can have it on a splitscreen, or on a tap so that you can use it whenever you need it.
