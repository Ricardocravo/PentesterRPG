.minimum requirements to play:
.. internet acess
... installing Conquering_The_Ethereal_Empire_install.sh (if you feel unsafe you can check what you're installing earlier)
.... zero knowledge in programming or cybersecurity experience

    In order for the game to function you will need to install a few libraries, I've placed them all inside a file called Conquering_The_Ethereal_Empire_install.sh
    You can open the file to check which libraries are you installing with the command : 

        code /workspaces/PentesterRPG/Conquering_The_Ethereal_Empire/install.sh     

    You can navigate through the explorer has there are no rulles to this game, but the game was created to be played using just the terminal.
    Yhis game was made with the purpose of giving you a joyfull experience while training programming and cybersecurity. 
    There are also no rulles for the language models you want to use, I will provide enough to end the game. 
    you can use anything i haven't made, and that's what it is funny about this idea i had. 
    A programmer can create anything he wants, that's why i created this game.
    You don't need to read the full content of the game story, or even play the game if you don't feel like it. 
    You can just skip the story and just decrypt all the six thousand levels using machine learning or explorer. 
    The six thousand levels where designed by me at the day 28-11-2023 but they are not done, only their structure was made using linux OS.

    I would be gratefull if you can spot anny errors in text,scripts or commands, reporting them to my e-mail so that i can fix them.
