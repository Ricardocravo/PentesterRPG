Setting up Java and Python across all other codespaces for wget players

The default devcontainer.json file used by GitHub Codespaces does not automatically include specific language runtimes such as Python and Java. If you use the game outside this code space you’ll need to:

1. Create a devcontainer.json file in the repository and add the necessary configurations for Python and Java, as shown in the previous answer.

1. Share the devcontainer.json file and the source code with the players, so they can use it to set up their local environment.
