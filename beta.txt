##Add shortcuts for ever to the terminal

#!/bin/bash

# Add the script's directory to the PATH environment variable
export PATH=$PATH:$(dirname $0)

# Define the open_bag function
function open_bag {
    # Your function code here
}


or 


alias open_bag='./open_bag.sh'


Method 1: Using the export command

    Pros:
        Allows developers to set the PATH environment variable for the current shell session, which means that the open_bag command can be executed without specifying the full path to the script.
        Once the export command is run, the PATH environment variable is set for the current shell session, which means that the open_bag command can be executed without specifying the full path to the script for the duration of the session.
        This method is useful when developers need to execute the open_bag command multiple times in the same shell session.
    Cons:
        The export command only sets the PATH environment variable for the current shell session, which means that the open_bag command will not be available in other shell sessions or to other users.
        This method is not as flexible as the second method, as it only allows developers to set the PATH environment variable for the current shell session.

Method 2: Using the alias command

    Pros:
        Allows developers to create an alias for the open_bag command, which means that they can execute the command by typing a shorter name.
        Once the alias command is run, the alias is saved in the user's shell configuration file, which means that the open_bag command can be executed by typing the alias for the duration of the user's shell session.
        This method is useful when developers need to execute the open_bag command frequently and want to save time by typing a shorter name.
    Cons:
        The alias command only creates an alias for the current user and shell session, which means that the alias will not be available to other users or in other shell sessions.
        This method is not as flexible as the first method, as it only allows developers to create an alias for the current user and shell session.
