## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please kindly report it to me as soon as possible. I take security very 
seriously thank's to CS50, and I am committed in addressing any 
vulnerabilities as fast as I can or to explain that it was meant to be
like that, remembering the game is a mix of RPG with Cyber Security.

If you've found a vulnerability please send an email to pentesterrpg@gmail.com 
describing the issue with most of the details in order to make me able to 
reproduce the vulnerability. I will let you know about the receipt 
of your report within 24hours and will work to verify and reproduce the 
vulnerability as quickly as possible, so that i can start searching for a fix.
I will provide regular updates while on progress. 

Please respect the privacy of others and make reasonable efforts to contact us
before disclosing any vulnerabilities publicly. As a sole developer of this game
my responsability is to address alone all the vulnerabilities and improve the security 
of PentesterRPG.

I appreciate your help in keeping the project secure and welcome any feedback or 
suggestions that you might may have.

There are no payment or rewards for reporting vulnerabilities outside of an established bug
bounty program setted earlier as i am not able to afford that, and that's why i've 
started as a Sole developer of a huge idea i have.
