## Branch guide

- see current branch:
`git branch`
- create branch: (c* = create)
`git branch -c development_name`
- check current status:
`git status`  
- change branch:
`git checkout branchname`
- add file or all files:
`git add name.file`
`git add .`
- commit: (m* = message)
`git commit -m "feature:test new feature"`
- push from branch to main:
`git push origin HEAD`

### If changes made in main, upload all to branch

- upload from main: `git config pull.rebase true`
- push from main to branch: `git pull`

***

- push from branch to main: `git push origin head`

***

- **SUCESS** Create pull request from branch to main without deleting:
  - If warned about bypass instead of creating a pull request, rules are not ok.

```md
git add .
git commit -m "feat: testing"
git push origin HEAD
git checkout main
git pull origin development
git push
```
