    ```shell
    git commit --all --fixup HEAD
    git push
    ```

### Updating the commit message

Updating the commit message of the last commit:

1. Check out branch:

    ```shell
    git checkout choosenname
    ```

2. Amend the last commit and modify the commit message:

    ```shell
    git commit --amend
    ```

3. Push to your GitHub repository:

    ```shell
    git push --force-with-lease
    ```

4. Update earlier commit

    ```shell
    git rebase
    ```

***

### After PR is merged

Delete branch and pull the changes from the main (upstream) repository:

1. Delete the remote branch on GitHub either through the GitHub web UI or your local shell as follows:

    ```shell
    git push origin --delete my-fix-branch
    ```

2. Check out the main branch:

    ```shell
    git checkout main -f
    ```

3. Delete the local branch:

    ```shell
    git branch -D my-fix-branch
    ```

4. Update your local `main` with the latest upstream version:

    ```shell
    git pull --ff upstream main
    ```

### Commit Message Format

Easier to read commit history: **header**, **body**, and **footer**.

- [x] header:
- [ ] blank line.
- [x] body:
- [ ] blank line.
- [x] footer:

The `header` is mandatory.

The `body` is mandatory for all commits except `docs:`\
Resume of commits

The `footer` is optional.

The `<type>` and `<summary>` fields are mandatory, the `(<scope>)` field is optional.

***

### Types

- **build**: build system or external dependencies.
- **ci**: Changes to CI.
- **docs**: Documentation only changes.
- **feat**: New feature.
- **fix**: Bug fix.
- **perf**: Improves performance.
- **refactor**: Changes that neither fixes bugs nor features.
- **test**: Adding tests or correcting tests.

Few exceptions:

- `packaging`: public path changes, package.json changes done to all packages, file/format changes, changes to bundles, etc.

- `changelog`: updating release notes in CHANGELOG.md

- `dev-infra`: used for dev-infra related changes within the directories /scripts and /tools

- `docs-infra`: used for docs-app (angular.io) related changes within the /aio directory of the repo

- `migrations`: used for changes to the `ng update` migrations.

- `devtools`: used for changes in the [browser extension](./devtools/README.md).

- none/empty string: useful for `test` and `refactor` changes that are done across all packages (e.g. `test: add missing unit tests`) and for docs changes that are not related to a specific package (e.g. `docs: fix typo in tutorial`).

***

### Summary

Use the summary field to provide a succinct description of the change:

- use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes".
- don't capitalize the first letter.
- no dot (.) at the end.

***

### Commit Message Body

Use the imperative, present tense: "fix" not "fixed" nor "fixes".

Explain *why* you are making the change.
Can include a comparison.

***

### Commit Message Footer

For example:

```md

```

or

```md
DEPRECATED: <what is deprecated>
<BLANK>
<deprecation description + recommended update path>
<BLANK>

```

Breaking Change section `BREAKING CHANGE:` + summary + blank line + a detailed description of the breaking change that also includes migration instructions.

Deprecation section `DEPRECATED:` + summary + blank line + detailed description of the deprecation that also mentions the recommended update path.

***
